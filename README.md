# How To Use
To use this plugin, all you, as the user, has to do is place the LimitedCreative.jar file into your "Plugins" folder on your 1.13+ server. After booting up the server for the first time, a folder within your plugins folder named "LimitedCreative" is made. Inside that folder is a config.yml file, which you can configure.
