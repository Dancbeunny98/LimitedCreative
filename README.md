# LimitedCreative

A plugin meant for allowing the server owner/developer to give out creative mode with restrictions.

Features:
Custom blacklisted blocks - refer to the config.yml
Custom blacklisted interactables - refer to the config.yml

Permissions:
  "limitedcreative" - the base permission allowing one to run the /limitedcreative or /lc command. Also allows them to give LC to other players.
  "limitedcreative.admin" - users with this are given permission to bypass the blacklist for blocks and interactables.

The "master" branch contains the code for this project.
