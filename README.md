# LimitedCreative

A plugin meant for allowing the server owner/developer to give out creative mode with restrictions.

## Features:
- Custom blacklisted blocks - refer to the config.yml (use block names, i.e. diamond_block)
- Custom blacklisted interactables - refer to the config.yml (use block names, i.e. trapped_chest)


## Permissions:
 - "limitedcreative" - the base permission allowing one to run the /limitedcreative or /lc command. Also allows them to give LC to other players.
 - "limitedcreative.admin" - users with this are given permission to bypass the blacklist for blocks and interactables.

## Known Bugs:
  - Players are able to remove LC armor (The leather) if they shift-click on it.
      Progress - Unsure how to fix
  - Cannot blacklist the placement of entities (i.e. minecarts, spawn eggs, etc).
      Progress - Will be implemented sometime this week

The "master" branch contains the code for this project.
